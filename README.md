This is a small notes app made using Expo and React Native. It's not much to look at, but it does have:
- Fully functional note taking (creation, editing, deletion)
- Custom bottom sheets
- Full markdown functionality
- Saving on backing out of notes
- Modals
- Drawer navigation and general navigation between screens
- Note selection

Feel free to clone and play around with it yourself, or use it as inspiration. Outside of that, it's not really intended for others to use
